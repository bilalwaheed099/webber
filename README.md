### `How to run`

1. Clone the repository from github.
2. Run 'npm install' to install the dependencies
3. Execute command 'npm run start' to start the development server
4. Execute command 'npm run build' to build the app for production.

The links of the pages are as follows:
1. homepage - http://localhost:3000/
2. pricing - http://localhost:3000/pricing
3. case-studies - http://localhost:3000/case-studies
4. case-studies-inner - http://localhost:3000/case-studies-inner

However, the navigation links within the website work fine and can be used. 
To go to the "case studies inner" page, click on any "Read more ->" button 
in the case studies page.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
